Nosedive explores beyond the current limits of games of maneuver. Rather than moving
pieces, players explore an island by drawing directly on the board, creating aesthetic works
through play. Every match ends with a permanent record of the game, which can be evaluated
both tactically and as a visual artifact. Nosedive is for tactical game veterans and beginners
alike. We invite you to try this unique approach to a classic style of play.
