title: Podcast collaborate with Indienova.com

*Indienova* is a game media website focused on indie games based in Chinese context.
Personally I believe this is one of the best game medias in China for their understanding
and professionality of game, as well as their broad view among China and worldwide market,
 which is kinda hard - most people either familiar with international market, or China market.

 This is *not* Chinese Exceptionalism, it's just because of different censorship,
 audience acceptance and consumer custom.

 Anyway, we hold a new podcast together with Indienova, focusing on game design
  prospective. The program is recorded using Chinese, hope you are good at Chinese XD
