title: Moving to Jekyll
---

Finally decided that I should use jekyll to build my own blog, and (after several hours struggle) it really feels great!

AND Markdown is so awesome that I didn't really want to switch to another blog engine now. I used to worried about whether Markdown would support Chinese or not, but when I actually tried it, 完全没问题啊。

虽然说中英文混编看起来有点诡异，不过这个也算是一直以来的老大难问题了。如果只是单独输入中文的话，看起来还是很美观的，可读性也比较高。

虽然不知道为什么比英文感觉要大一号。
