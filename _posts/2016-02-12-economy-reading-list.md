title: Economy reading list for non-economist
---

When I was a child, I always thought that Economics is all about money. Just like every idealist youth, I'm not a big fan of the concept of *money*; conversely, I held the idea that money is highly related to sin, not through a puritanic understanding, but more of a shallow observation from a teenager's eye.

However, my understanding of Economics, if not incorrect, is inaccurate. After several search I found that since the rise of behavior school, Economics has become a discipline that tries to abstract human into mathematics in order to understand them, (for me) as an alternative and simple black-box method instead of Psychology.

*That is what I'm really interested in.*

Also, from practice perspective of views, it's also helpful in my later game project, where I need to build a fictional country with at least basic economy systems for players to tweak around. Therefor I believe that some Economy readings is necessary.

The requirement for the readings is only 1: *Not Boring*.

Here is my list:

1. *Poor Economics*, by Duflo and Banerjee;
2. *Why Nations Fall*, by Acemoglu and Robinson;
3. *The Other Path*, by de Soto;
4. *Capital in the 21th Century*, by Piketty;
5. *The Price of Inequality*, by Stiglitz;
6. *Triumph of the City*, by Glaeser;
7. *The Grabbing Hand*, by Shleifer;
8. *The Economics of Life*, by Becker;
9. *Random Walk Down Wall Street*, by Malkiel;
10. *Irrational Exuberance*, by Shiller;
11. *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, by Kahneman;
12. *Freakonomics*, by Levitt and Dubner;
13. *The Honest Truth of Dishonesty*, by Ariely;

A good number for the amount of reading list. I'm so *evil*.
