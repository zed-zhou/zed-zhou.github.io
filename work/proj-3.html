Nosedive explores beyond the current limits of games of maneuver. Rather than moving
pieces, players explore an island by drawing directly on the board, creating aesthetic works
through play. Every match ends with a permanent record of the game, which can be evaluated
both tactically and as a visual artifact. Nosedive is for tactical game veterans and beginners
alike. We invite you to try this unique approach to a classic style of play.

Nosedive 试图探索桌面游戏游戏移动的边界。玩家并不简单地移动部件，而是真正在版面上构图绘画，在游玩的过程中创造出飞行的归结。每一场战斗结束后，都可以通过战略和美感的角度对游戏进行评价。Nosedive不仅是给硬核桌游玩家创造的，而且也支持初学者的游玩。

Nosedive has been positively received by playtesters, those new to the tactical maneuver genre, experienced wargamers, and industry veterans. I’m especially proud to say that Nosedive was an IndieCade 2016 Table Games Selection.
